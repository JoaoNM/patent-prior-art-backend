# STEP 1: Paste your patent abstract here.
# STEP 2: Detect keywords in the abstract 

# (GHOST STEP: Run inference query on the keywords, to find more related keywords (divergence))

# STEP 4: Query BQ to find patents with the detected keywords
# STEP 5: Run inference query on patents found compared with the original patent. MASK word should be the same in both cases. (run for every keyword)
# STEP 6: Get comparison score, and return top 10 patents with the highest score.
